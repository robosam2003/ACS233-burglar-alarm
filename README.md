# ACS233-burglar-alarm
A burglar alarm system - Group 4
This is a buglar alarm system with facial recongnition feature 

This code is currently public so the marker (Tara) can view, but is scheduled to go private soon to avoid future plagarism.

We are using the face recognition library for python: https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition
