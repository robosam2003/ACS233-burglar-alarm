# ACS233-burglar-alarm
A burglar alarm system - Group 4
This is a buglar alarm system with facial recongnition feature 

This code is currently public so the marker (Tara) can view, but is scheduled to go private in 8 weeks (22/03/2023) to avoid future plagarism.

We are using the face recognition library for python: https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition
